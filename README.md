# Application
Project for learn how to use viewpager2

The idea of this project is to make an application in which the user can study english theory and perform test tasks
There are 4 pages in ViewPager 2 each of them shows theory and practice block
There is only one test for each pages but it is not difficlt to make more

At this project I have used recyclerview adapter to make theory and practice lists and to provide ViewPager2 with elements
Also I have used library for displaying ViewPager2 scrolling (https://github.com/romandanylyk/PageIndicatorView)
